## About The Project

This repository contains a comprehensive exercise set covering sections 10 & 11 of the Udemy course, "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)," instructed by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The content is up-to-date as of May 2023.

This iteration might feature alterations compared to the initial course code, including modifications in file names, functions, or variables.

The project was created using the ECMAScript Modules (ESM) system as it aligns with the latest JavaScript programming standards and represents an enhancement over the original code.
